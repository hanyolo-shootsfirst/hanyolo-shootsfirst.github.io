The competition required us to complete a series of tasks using a multifunctional autonomous robot: 
  - following a black strip of electrical tape
  - detecting and collecting objects the size of a soda
  - crossing 6" gaps
  - detecting a fluctuating Infra-Red signal
  - detecting edges and avoiding a fall off the competition surface

Our strategy evolved with time. Initially the goal was to follow the tape using PD control, crossing one gap using an aluminium bridge, until the tape's end while collecting all 3 Ewoks using a double jointed claw and detecting R2D2's signal. After that we would cross the second gap and apply an edge detection mechanism to lead us to the prime prize Chewbacca then ziplining all objects to safety.

On the err of prudency we ammended our strategy as our sense of what could be accomplished with our time limitations improved. We would now follow the tape to its end as before (foregoing the rest of teh path to Chewbacca) then return to the start with the Ewoks we had rescued.

By competition day, the major functionalities of the robot were in order and the robot could peform all its indended tasks. The largest point of uncertainty was in setting the parameters that calibarated the robot. For this we would have required more time and testing on the track. As a result our competition score was lower than expected.
