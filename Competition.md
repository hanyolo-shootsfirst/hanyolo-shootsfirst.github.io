The competition required us to complete a series of tasks using a multifunctional autonomous robot: 
  - following tape
  - detecting and collecting objects
  - crossing a gaps
  - detecting an Infra-Red signal
  - detecting edges and avoiding a fall of the competition surface

Our strategy evolved with time. Initially the goal was to follow the tape until it ended while collecting all 3 Ewoks and detecting R2D2's signal. After that we would cross the second gap and apply an edge detection mechanism to lead us to the prime prize Chewabacca then ziplining all objects to safety.

On the err of prudency we ammended our strategy as our sense of what could be accomplished with our time limitations improved. We would now follow the tape to its end as before then return to the start with the Ewoks we had rescued.
