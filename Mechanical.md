The mechanical components of our robot consisted of five main parts. These parts were, the chassis, basket, scissor lift, bridge as well as the claw and arm. The philosophy we followed when designing each part of the robot was to have a simple modular design that we can test separately and easily integrate later.

We designed each component using onShape a free online CAD software, making collaboration a simple process. To manufacture each element of our robot, we used a combination of laser cut and waterjet cut parts as well as a few 3D printed parts.

## Chassis

We made the chassis out of high density fiberboard (hardboard), Since it was a light but strong material which was easy to prototype with on the laser cutter. We went through several iterations of the design, tweaking it each time to accommodate other parts of our robot. Finally, we settled with a design that maximized accessibility for our circuitry while also used the limited space efficiently by using a two level design.

## Claw

[Need something here!!]

##  Scissor Lift and Basket

We primarily designed the basket and scissor lift together. Due to the large size of the Ewoks and Chewie and the fact that our claw needed to drop them into the basket; we knew we needed a something large. Thus, to satisfy this need and given a limited amount of space we decided to make a wide and short basket. For our scissor lift, after several experiments with hardboard we utilized acrylic for to its relatively low friction as compared to hardboard. After first looking into a rack and pinion system and then a spool and string mechanism, we settled on a lead screw driven lift as this seemed to be the most reliable tool to actuate the lift.

## Bridge

Initially we had ideas of lifting ourselves over the gaps using two arms in front and two in back. However, we soon found that this idea would take more time to implement than was given for this project. Thus, we decided to use a bridge to cross the gap. Our bridge design followed our overall motive of keeping things simple and easy to design. We used sheet metal since it was light yet could be bent to make it much stronger. We added curls on the bottom of our bridge so that it would drop into the gap and be secure while we were moving over top.
