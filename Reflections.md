Bereket: This experience has taught me the lesson that a simple and robust design is most often the best design overall. We had several technical issues earlier on
when we were coming up for ways to implement out first gap crossing technique. We required a tremendous amount of torque and needed to have every component in the mechanism secured down so that it was robust and reliable. This proved to be a challenge and as time went on, we saw the time commitment required for this single mechanism rise. Thus, in the end, we decided on using a simpler bridge dropping method to save on much needed time to work on other modules of the robot.
