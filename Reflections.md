One thing we can certainly agree on is that this summer has been one of the most enriching, exciting, and efficient ways to learn engineering. It's difficult to try to summarize everything we've learned, but we all came out with reflections blah blah I hate this sentence. I haven't written anything in years lord help me (someone fix this or delete it)

We wanted a robot that was modular, one that could be taken apart easily and worked on separately. We did accomplish that, but we didn't spend enough time making sure that the parts we made were still *designed* to work together. As the competition approached, we ended up having to spend too much time trying to make all the pieces work together, something we may have been able to make smoother if we had spent more time designing everything together. 

Making the claw was a fantastic experience because I got to do a little bit of everything: mechanical design, fabrication, electrical connections and power, and software. I learned many valuable lessons (the hard way) about the importance of not relying on epoxy, the beauty of sheet metal, and current-greedy servo motors. 

## Bereket:

This experience has taught me the lesson that a simple and robust design is most often the best design overall. We had several technical issues earlier on when we were coming up for ways to implement out first gap crossing technique. We required a tremendous amount of torque and needed to have every component in the mechanism secured down so that it was robust and reliable. This proved to be a challenge and as time went on, we saw the time commitment required for this single mechanism rise. Thus, in the end, we decided on using a simpler bridge dropping method to save on much needed time to work on other modules of the robot.
