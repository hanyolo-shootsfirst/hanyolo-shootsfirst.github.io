Overall lessons learned and skills developed as a team: 
0. Working independently and contributing to a team effort.
1. Project management - setting goals, timelines and trying to stick with to them while being flexible to adapt to new information.
2. Attention to detail so as to minimize error in order to work within the time constraints.
3. Design and prototyping.
4. Debugging and finding the root cause of a problem.
5. Approaching problems from a 1st principles view point to avoid technical debt later on.
6. Grit in figuring things out after multiple attempts.

## Jessica:

We wanted a robot that was modular, one that could be taken apart easily and worked on separately. We did accomplish that, but we didn't spend enough time making sure that the parts we made were still *designed* to work together. As the competition approached, we ended up having to spend too much time trying to make all the pieces work together, something we may have been able to make smoother if we had spent more time designing everything together. 

Making the claw was a fantastic experience because I got to do a little bit of everything: mechanical design, fabrication, electrical connections and power, and software. I learned many valuable lessons (the hard way) about the importance of not relying on epoxy, the beauty of sheet metal, and current-greedy servo motors. 

## Bereket:

This experience has taught me the lesson that a simple and robust design is most often the best design overall. We had several technical issues earlier on when we were coming up for ways to implement out first gap crossing technique. We required a tremendous amount of torque and needed to have every component in the mechanism secured down so that it was robust and reliable. This proved to be a challenge and as time went on, we saw the time commitment required for this single mechanism rise. Thus, in the end, we decided on using a simpler bridge dropping method to save on much needed time to work on other modules of the robot. 

## Brendon:

Working effectively in a team environment was a key learning point. Setting goals and tasks to be done was an evolving process and watching team dynamics evolve throughout the team was fascinating. Time constraints were palpable and the frustrations of facing setbacks due to the natural learning process led to a few full nights at the lab.

The importance of structured thinking became apparent early on and our approach to the problem; modular, simple and effective design work, yielded some good results. We adopted a continuous feedback loop within the team to achieve synergy. Some invaluable engineering principles were learnt: coming up with a schematic for your work before prototyping, documenting processes, debugging best practices.
