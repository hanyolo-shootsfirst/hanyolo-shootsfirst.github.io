I don't think we really need a blog feature on here, but it could be useful if that's how we want to organize information. We can show code snippets like this, for example:

{% highlight c++ %}
void pickUpRight(){
  swivel();
  moveClaw(susan, susanRight);
  openGrip();
  moveClaw(base, baseRightDown);
  moveClaw(elbow, elbowRightDown);
  closeGrip();
  swivel();
  dropoff();
}

{% endhighlight %}

We can also show math. Well, not at this moment, because I'm too lazy to set MathJax up. We probably won't really need it anyway.
